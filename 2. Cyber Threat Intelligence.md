# Cyber Threat Intelligence


**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** is information about cyber threats that helps organizations understand, prevent, and respond to attacks. It includes details about attackers, their methods, and potential threats to an organizationâ€™s systems.

CTI helps in:
ðŸ”¹ Identifying who is attacking (threat actors)
ðŸ”¹ Understanding how they attack (techniques, tools)
ðŸ”¹ Predicting what they might do next
ðŸ”¹ Strengthening defenses to prevent attacks


### Types of Cyber Threat Intelligence

CTI is divided into four main types based on its purpose and level of detail:

    Strategic Intelligence
        * High-level insights on long-term security risks and trends.
        * Used by executives and decision-makers.

    Tactical Intelligence
        * Focuses on attackers' tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
        * Used by security teams to improve defense strategies.

    Operational Intelligence
        * Real-time intelligence on active threats.
        * Used for immediate response to attacks.

    Technical Intelligence
        * Includes specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) like IP addresses, malware signatures, and domain names.
        * Used by security analysts to detect and block threats.
