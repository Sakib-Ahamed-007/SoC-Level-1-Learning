# Cyber Threat Intelligence


**Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** is information about cyber threats that helps organizations understand, prevent, and respond to attacks. It includes details about attackers, their methods, and potential threats to an organization’s systems.

CTI helps in:
🔹 Identifying who is attacking (threat actors)
🔹 Understanding how they attack (techniques, tools)
🔹 Predicting what they might do next
🔹 Strengthening defenses to prevent attacks


### Types of Cyber Threat Intelligence

CTI is divided into four main types based on its purpose and level of detail:

    Strategic Intelligence
        * High-level insights on long-term security risks and trends.
        * Used by executives and decision-makers.

    Tactical Intelligence
        * Focuses on attackers' tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
        * Used by security teams to improve defense strategies.

    Operational Intelligence
        * Real-time intelligence on active threats.
        * Used for immediate response to attacks.

    Technical Intelligence
        * Includes specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) like IP addresses, malware signatures, and domain names.
        * Used by security analysts to detect and block threats.

    

## Threat Intelligence Tools

There are several Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tools used by organizations to detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats. Here are some of the most widely used ones:
1️⃣ **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**

These platforms collect, analyze, and share threat intelligence from multiple sources.

 * Recorded Future – Uses AI to analyze cyber threats in real-time.
 * ThreatConnect – Combines CTI with security automation.
 * Anomali ThreatStream – Aggregates threat feeds for better detection.
 * MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) – An open-source platform for sharing threat intelligence.

2️⃣ **Threat Hunting & Detection Tools**

These tools actively search for cyber threats before they cause harm.

 * Splunk Enterprise Security – Detects anomalies using real-time analytics.
 * IBM QRadar – Uses AI to detect and investigate threats.
 * Elastic Security (ELK Stack) – An open-source tool for log analysis and threat detection.
 * CrowdStrike Falcon X – A cloud-based endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution.

3️⃣ **Malware Analysis & Sandbox Tools**

These tools analyze suspicious files and detect malware behavior.

 * VirusTotal – A free online tool that scans files and URLs using multiple antivirus engines.
 * Any.Run – An interactive sandbox for analyzing malware in real time.
 * Cuckoo Sandbox – An open-source tool for automating malware analysis.
 * Hybrid Analysis – Provides deep insights into file behavior.

4️⃣ **Threat Feeds & OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) Tools**

These tools provide real-time threat data from various sources.

 * AlienVault OTX (Open Threat Exchange) – A global threat-sharing platform.
 * Shodan – A search engine for discovering exposed devices and vulnerabilities.
 * Censys – Similar to Shodan but provides more detailed internet asset tracking.
 * Maltego – A powerful OSINT tool for cyber investigations.

5️⃣ **Dark Web Monitoring & Threat Attribution**

These tools monitor cybercriminal activities on the dark web.

 * DarkTracer – Tracks ransomware leaks and cybercriminal forums.
 * Constella Intelligence – Monitors dark web credentials and data breaches.
 * KELA – Provides intelligence on cybercriminal marketplaces.
