**YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym)** is an open-source tool used for malware analysis and detection. It helps security researchers identify and classify malware by creating rules based on patterns found in malicious files.
YARA works by scanning files and memory for specific strings, byte sequences, or behaviors that match predefined YARA rules. These rules help detect malware families, exploits, and other security threats.
