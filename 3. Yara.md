**YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym)** is an open-source tool used for malware analysis and detection. It helps security researchers identify and classify malware by creating rules based on patterns found in malicious files.
YARA works by scanning files and memory for specific strings, byte sequences, or behaviors that match predefined YARA rules. These rules help detect malware families, exploits, and other security threats.


## Installation

**Windows**

    * Using precompiled binaries
        Download the latest release from: https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/releases
        Extract and add the yara.exe path to the system environment variables.

    * Using Chocolatey (recommended)

         choco install yara

**Using Python (if you want to use YARA with scripts)**

    pip install yara-python

**Linux/macOS**

    Install via package manager:
    
    sudo apt install yara  # Ubuntu/Debian
    sudo dnf install yara  # Fedora
    brew install yara      # macOS (Homebrew)
    

**Verify installation:**

    yara --version


## Writing Basic YARA Rules

A YARA rule is a set of conditions that define how to detect a file.

    rule Rule_Name {
    meta:
        author = "Your Name"
        description = "Detects suspicious files"
        date = "2025-02-18"

    strings:
        $text1 = "malicious_string"
        $hex1 = { E8 ?? ?? ?? ?? 85 C0 75 0A }

    condition:
        any of them
    }

**Explanation:**

**meta** - Stores metadata (optional) and does not execute. More like a comment.
**strings** - Defines search patterns (text, hex, regex) which is than matched against the file.
**condition** - Specifies the logic to trigger a match. Here **any of them** means it will match against both **$text1** and **$hex1**. If we wanted to match against only one of them we could just mention that variable in the condition.


## Running a YARA Scan

**Scan a File:**
    yara my_rule.yar sample_file.exe

**Scan a Directory**
    yara -r my_rule.yar /path/to/folder/

**Scan Memory (Windows Only)**
    yara64.exe -p 1234 my_rule.yar
This scans process 1234 for matches.


## Advanced YARA Rules

**Using Regular Expressions**

    rule Detect_Email_Exfiltration {
    strings:
        $email_regex = /[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/
    condition:
        any of them
    }

This detects email addresses in a file.

**Combining Conditions**
Much like programming languages comparison and conditional operators can also be used. **(<=, <, !=, >=, and, or, not)**

    rule Detect_Advanced_Malware {
    strings:
        $s1 = "malware"
        $s2 = { 6A 00 68 58 89 E5 }
    condition:
        ($s1 or $s2) and filesize < 100KB
    }

The rule detects **malware signatures** if the file is under **100KB**.



## YARA Modules: Expanding Detection Capabilities

YARA modules are built-in extensions that provide additional functionality beyond basic string and pattern matching. These modules help analyze specific file types, metadata, cryptographic hashes, PE structures, and more.

### Common YARA Modules

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PE Module (Portable Executables)

The PE module extracts key information from Windows EXE/DLL files, such as:

    File characteristics (e.g., compiler, timestamp)
    Sections and imports (e.g., kernel32.dll)
    Digital signatures and entry points

üìå Example: Detect PE Files Compiled in 2024

    import "pe"

    rule Detect_New_PE {
        condition:
            pe.timestamp >= 1704067200  // Timestamp for Jan 1, 2024
    }

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hash Module (File Fingerprinting)

The hash module allows YARA to compute MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes of files.
üìå Example: Detect Known Malicious Hash

    import "hash"

    rule Detect_Malicious_File {
        condition:
            hash.md5(0, filesize) == "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e"
    }

üîπ This rule scans files and checks if their MD5 hash matches a known malware sample.
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Math Module (Entropy Detection)

The math module calculates entropy, which helps detect packed or obfuscated malware.
üìå Example: Detect Packed Malware Using High Entropy

    import "math"

    rule Detect_Packed_Binary {
        condition:
            math.entropy(0, filesize) > 7.5  // High entropy suggests packed files
    }

üîπ Malware authors often compress or encrypt executables to evade detection. High entropy (7.5+) is a strong indicator of packing.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Magic Module (File Type Detection)

The magic module identifies file types based on their headers (like Linux file command).
üìå Example: Detect PDF Files

    import "magic"

    rule Detect_PDF {
        condition:
            magic.mime_type(0, filesize) == "application/pdf"
    }

üîπ This rule detects PDF files regardless of their extension.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cuckoo Module (Sandbox Analysis)

The Cuckoo module analyzes malware based on behavioral reports from Cuckoo Sandbox.
üìå Example: Detect Malware Dropping Executables

    import "cuckoo"

    rule Detect_Malware_Dropper {
        condition:
            cuckoo.files_created(/.*\.exe$/)  // Checks if an EXE file was created
    }

üîπ This rule flags malware that drops executable files, a common attack pattern.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Dotnet Module (.NET Executables)

The Dotnet module extracts metadata from .NET applications.
üìå Example: Detect .NET Malware

    import "dotnet"

    rule Detect_NET_Malware {
        condition:
            dotnet.version == "v4.0.30319" and dotnet.strong_name_present
    }

üîπ Detects malicious .NET binaries based on version and strong name signature.
